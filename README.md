Travel Tracker app created to allow users to plan, track and relive the trips they've taken. This app allows for users to pin point their trips. The journal tab allows the user to make notes about their trip details - which could be about past, current, or future trips they would like to take. I look forward to expanding on this application in the future.

I feel like the biggest challenge was the GoogleMaps. My intial goal was to have geolocation play apart of the app, however I couldn't get the google maps and the geolocation to work cohesively. I spent dozens of hours just trying to get closer to my goal. Then I moved on to the idea of creating markers on the map that contained the trip details but I had issues trying to attach the information. It's definitely something I would like to expand on in the future but maybe as a beginner it's too big of task to take on.

Another thing I would like to add onto is the photo portion of the journal, to allow a photo album but for the time being to save on space for not only the servers but the user - the thumbnail is perfect for a simple idea of what's being noted.
